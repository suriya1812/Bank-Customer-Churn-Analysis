In the rapidly evolving banking sector, customer retention has become a critical concern. Banks are increasingly seeking to understand the factors that influence customer decisions to stay with or leave their banking service provider. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing various attributes of bank customers to identify key predictors of customer churn. By leveraging data analytics, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that could help devise strategies to enhance customer retention and reduce churn rates.

Expectations:
Through this project, you are expected to apply a variety of data analytics techniques ranging from descriptive statistics to hypothesis testing. By the end of this analysis, you should be able to:

Identify and Understand Key Factors: Recognize which customer attributes significantly impact the likelihood of churn.
Develop Analytical Skills: Enhance proficiency in using statistical tools and software for analyzing complex datasets.
Generate Insights: Produce actionable insights that could theoretically be used by a bank to improve customer retention strategies.
Present Findings: Effectively communicate their findings and recommendations through clear, compelling visualizations and reports.
Suggestions for learners:
1. Descriptive Statistics
Basic Statistics: Calculate mean, median, and mode for numerical columns like CreditScore, Age, Balance, NumOfProducts, EstimatedSalary, and Points Earned.
Distribution Analysis: Analyze the distribution of key numerical variables using histograms and box plots to understand the spread and central tendency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Analysis: Explore the correlation between numerical features and the Exited variable to identify potential predictors of churn.
Customer Profile Analysis: Segment customers based on key demographics (Age, Geography, Gender) to identify which groups are more likely to churn.

3. Comparative Analysis
Churn by Geography: Compare churn rates across different geographical locations to see if certain regions have higher churn rates.
Gender Differences in Churn: Analyze churn rates between different genders to explore if gender plays a significant role in churn.

4. Behavioral Analysis
Product and Services Usage: Examine how the number of products (NumOfProducts) a customer uses affects their likelihood to churn.
Activity Level Analysis: Investigate the relationship between being an IsActiveMember and customer churn.

5. Financial Analysis
Balance vs. Churn: Analyze how customer balance levels correlate with churn rates.
Credit Card Ownership: Determine if owning a credit card (HasCrCard) impacts customer loyalty.

6. Customer Satisfaction and Feedback
Complaint Analysis: Study the impact of having a complaint (Complain) on customer churn.
Satisfaction and Churn: Explore how the Satisfaction Score relates to churn, especially among those who have filed complaints.

7. Card Usage Analysis
Impact of Card Type on Churn: Examine if different Card Types have different churn rates.
Loyalty Points Analysis: Investigate whether Points Earned from credit card usage influence customer retention.

8. Salary Analysis
Salary and Churn: Analyze the relationship between EstimatedSalary and customer churn, focusing on how financial well-being might influence churn decisions.

9. Insights and Recommendation
Please add all the insights that you got from the data and recommendations that you have for reducing churn
